## ðŸ’¥Abstract

Remote proctoring is the act of invigilating an online exam from any location to clamp down on aberrant behavior or cheating instances to ensure a cheat-free assessment environment. A remotely proctored exam is administered by experienced human proctors, an AI Algorithm, or both to maintain integrity. In this project, we present ways to improve reliability of proctoring by generating plots of each parameter measured during the online evaluation.
